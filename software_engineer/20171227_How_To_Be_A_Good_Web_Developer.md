Here is a [link](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-be-an-uncommonly-good-web-developer-7f745978351f) to the medium post.

## My first job
* Self taught web developer: Felt incompetent
* Fortunately, I had supportive supervisors and coworkers
* There are some principles that will help you stand out in a crowd

## Principles to remember
  1. Mastering something is a marathon, not a sprint
  2. Try hard before asking for help
  3. Stay curious: Desire to understand how things work
  4. Analyze and learn from mistakes
  5. Get really good at solving problems
  6. Work on your soft skills (people skills)
  7. Be proactive, not reactive
