##Cons of Native Apps
* Write three different apps, one for Android, one for iOS, and one for the web
* App install friction
  * takes about 6 clicks to get the app installed
  * 20% of the user drop out for each click before installing the app
  
##Why Native Apps are Gamble
* 60% of Google Play app store have **never been downloaded**
* Average mobile users download **less than three apps per month**
* 94% of mobile revenue comes from **1% of publishers**
* **80% of users** who downloaded an app fails to become active users
