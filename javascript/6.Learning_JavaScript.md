# Learning JavaScript, 3rd Edition
## Chapter 6. Functions
* Method: When a function is a property of an object
```
const obj = {
  name: 'Sungho',
  greet() {    // greet is a method of obj
    console.log(this.name)
  }
}
```

* `this` keyword: In above example, `this` refers to the object instance `obj`
* `this` is bound according to **how the function is called**, not where the function is defined
```
const greet = obj.greet
greet === obj.greet
greet()   // '' because the function is not directly called on an object, `this` is not bound to anything
```
* Arrow notation (`=>`) function: `this` is bound lexically (bound where the function is defined)
```
const obj = {
  name: 'Sungho',
  greetBackward() {
    const reverseName = () => {
      return reverse(this.name)   // `this` is bound to the obj
    }
    return reverseName()
  }
}
```
* `call`, `apply` and `bind`
  * `call`: call a function with an object bound to `this` as the first argument
  * Rest arguments of `call` are passed to the function as parameters
  * `apply`: identical to `call`, but the second argument is an array of parameters to the function
  * `bind`: returns a function with the first argument as an object bound to `this`, instead of executingn the function
