#Understanding ES6 by Nicholas Zakas

##Chapter 1: Block Bindings
* Hoisting: Variables declared with `var` are treated as if they are at the top of the function
* ES6 introduces **block-level declaration** to provide more control over variable life cycle
  * Variables declared in a block scope are inaccessible outside the scope
  * Block scopes are created in
    * Inside a **function**
    * Inside a block (between `{` `}`)
* `let`: Similar to `var`, but only assessible in the current scope and won't be hoisted
* `const`: Constant which must be initialized on declaration and once declared, it cannot be reassigned
* Object declaration with `const`: Possible to modify object since it's not reassigning the `const` itself
```
const person = {}
person.name = 'Sungho'      // This is valid
person = { name: 'Sungho' } // This throws an error
```

* **Best practice**: Use `const` by default, only use `let` when you know a variable needs to be reassigned later!

##Chapter 2: Strings and Regular Expressions
* Surrogate pairs: A UTF-16 character that is represented with two 16-bit code units
* `codePointAt()`: Returns the Unicode code point at a given position
* `fromCodePoint()`: Returns a character corresponding to the given code point
* ES6 supports regular expression with `u` flag, which stands for Unicode: Use characters instead of code unit
* Regular expressions with `source` and `flags` property
* In addition to `indexOf()` to identify substring, following methods are added:
  * `includes(string, index)`: True if `string` found within the string searching from `index`
  * `startsWith(string, index)`: True if `string` found at the beginning of the string from `index`
  * `endsWith(string, index)`: True if `string` found at the end of the string searching from `length - index`
  * `repeat(n)`: Returns a new string repeating the original string `n` number of times
