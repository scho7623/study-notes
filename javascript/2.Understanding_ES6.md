#Understanding ES6 by Nicholas Zakas

##Chapter 1: Block Bindings
* Hoisting: Variables declared with `var` are treated as if they are at the top of the function
* ES6 introduces **block-level declaration** to provide more control over variable life cycle
  * Variables declared in a block scope are inaccessible outside the scope
  * Block scopes are created in
    * Inside a **function**
    * Inside a block (between `{` `}`)
* `let`: Similar to `var`, but only assessible in the current scope and won't be hoisted
* `const`: Constant which must be initialized on declaration and once declared, it cannot be reassigned
* Object declaration with `const`: Possible to modify object since it's not reassigning the `const` itself
```
const person = {}
person.name = 'Sungho'      // This is valid
person = { name: 'Sungho' } // This throws an error
```

* **Best practice**: Use `const` by default, only use `let` when you know a variable needs to be reassigned later!
